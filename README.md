# X-ray classification  Of Pnemonia in  Patients

## Overview

#### AI technology has had a massive impact on the world from Chat GPT & their vast NLP model to Netflix and their Recommendation Systems. The impact AI has on our day-to-day lives is undeniable. In the field of Diagnostics and Medicine, X-ray classification has the potential to streamline the diagnosis of many ailments. On a deeper level technology such as this can pick up on unique identifiable features that may not be distinguishable to the human eye. In this project I will explain to you the methodology behind the mdeling process used to classify X-ray images displaying normal lungs and lungs containing either bacterial or vira pneumonia.  

## Business Understanding

#### According to UNICEF childhood Pneumonia takes the lives if more than 725,000 childrens annually. This issue still persists today due to the lack of proper healthcare and reliable diagnostic methods in regions of the world such as Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to the sparsity of diagnosticians in these areas of the world technology that can classify pneumonia using X-ray images can be invaluable in terms of efficiently and accurately detecting pneumonia.

#### A Convolution Nerual Network was used in the modeling Process.

#### Final Loss(Validation): 0.152  Final Accuracy(Validation): 94.9%


## Final Model (Best)

#### Final Loss(Training): 0.000   Accuracy(Training): 100%
#### Final Loss(Validation): 0.208  Final Accuracy(Validation): 97.9%

## Test Data
#### Final Loss: 2.18 Final Accuracy: 83%

## Conclusion

#### Based on the low accuracy score on the test data I wouldn't be confortable releasing the current model into production. In addition to this, accuracy may not have been the best metric to evaluate the moodels performance. When looking at the accuracy scoe of the test set in comparison to the validation set there was a very signaficant difference of about 15%. This diefference might quite possibly be due to improper class labeling. This error could possibly be rectified by splitting the training data into a training, validation, and test set.

### Next Steps

#### Further Tuning would be necessary to build a viable X-ray classification program for detecting pneumonia. In additiona to this, the f1 score would be a much better metric used to evaluate this model. The worst possible outcome of this detection program would be the generation of false negatives, or failing to detect pneumonia in a patient's X-ray when they are afflicted with this ailment. The f1 metric allows us to look at the false negatives generated by this model so we can then adequately tune our model to minimize this result as much as possible. Another consideration would be using this model on X- rays of adults with the same condiction to see if the detection sytem works as good as it does on the pediatric X-rays. Finally, we should introduce fungal pneumonia into our training set instead of look at just bacterial and viral pneumonia.
